            <p>Dear Mr./Ms./Dr. [Last Name],</p>
    
            <p>
                I am writing to apply for the [Position] at [Company Name], which I discovered through [Source]. I am eager to be considered for this role based on my strong background in engineering, programming, and robotics, along with my hands-on project experience and leadership in educational outreach. My qualifications, including building a custom PC and teaching coding, robotics, and CAD to students, align closely with the skills and expertise needed for this position.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                In a paid role at Code Ninjas, I taught junior high school students coding, robotics, and CAD. This experience honed my ability to communicate complex technical concepts in an accessible way while working in a dynamic team environment. Additionally, my project work, including designing and assembling a custom PC to optimize performance for engineering tasks, has developed my technical skills in hardware assembly, system optimization, and troubleshooting. These experiences have given me the practical knowledge that I believe would benefit [Company Name] as it looks to fill this role.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Beyond my technical abilities, I am deeply passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, which aligns with [Company Name]’s mission. My volunteer work with organizations such as Sleeping Bags for the Homeless and my participation in the Civil Air Patrol have cultivated a strong sense of responsibility, teamwork, and community engagement—qualities that I am excited to bring to [Company Name].
            </p>
    
            <p>
                I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to [Company Name] and apply my skills to this position. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my qualifications align with the needs of your team. I can be reached at (669) 224-0032 or jasmehsudan@gmail.com and would be happy to arrange an interview at your convenience. Thank you for your time and consideration.
            </p>
    
            <p>Sincerely,<br>Jasmeh Sudan</p>
